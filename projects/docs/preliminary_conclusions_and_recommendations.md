# Preliminary conclusions & recommendations  

## Preliminary conclusions

***Preliminary conclusions***:

1. ***There are no women without a history of diabetes*** in the population (whatever the function that the factor we are using does).
2. If all women have a history of diabetes, ***there must be some risk factor in this population that does not exist in other populations***.
3. ***There are no ages, collected in the dataset, that allow us to infer a very long life expectancy*** in this population, that is, it is not a blue dot. Surely the life expectancy is < 90 years in women and even lower in men.
4. The BMI indicates that the population analyzed has a ***very high tendency to obesity*** (with some cases of morbid obesity).
5. The photo that the dataset expresses is of ***> 33% incidence of diabetes*** (type 2), in the female population. That is, we can speak of a ***diabetes epidemic that has spread generations into the past***.
6. If the survey covers 100% of the adult female population (21-81 years old), and the mode is 1 child per couple, then ***the total female population is very small***, so the total population must also be very small (less than 3,000 people, probably).
7. ***The average reproductive rate is only slightly above the population replacement rate***, so there could be a downward trend in the population and ***a demographic crisis could be brewing in this population***.
8. ***There must be some feature*** in this population, ***more important than age***, among the reasons for the high incidence of diabetes ***and that has to do with the high degree of obesity, for sure***.

## Recommendations

1. ***Healthier diet*** (lower in calories).
2. ***Regular physical exercise*** (ideally daily).
3. ***Urgent clinical treatment of diabetes cases***, whether prediabetes or diabetes (type 2).
4. ***Campaigns that promote the creation of couples with people who are not of the Pima ethnic group***, to prevent consanguinity in the population.
5. ***Improvement of health*** in general and especially of ***geriatric***.
