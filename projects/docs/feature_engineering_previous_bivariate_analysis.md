## Previous bivariate analysis

***Important***: That two events or phenomena are related to each other does not mean that one is the cause of the other. For example, the rooster crows shortly before dawn. But the crowing of the rooster is not the cause of the sun rising. It's not the first time we finish washing the car and it starts to rain, but for it to rain, we don't need to wash the car.

***Correlation does not imply causation***, therefore, we must have a context ([business rules](https://github.com/ddasilva64/DECTRE24001esp/tree/master/projects/docs/executive_summary_business_rules.md)) that helps us evaluate the possible relationships.
