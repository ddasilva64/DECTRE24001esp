## Numerical Characteristics (after outlier treatment)

***Pregnancies***  

Some women in the sample have many children (12 or more), although most have few; the normal is to have only 1 child.
It seems that in ***the graph of this category there should be a distribution skewed to the right and flattened (around 3 approximately)***.
***High data dispersion***.
***The outliers that have been completely eliminated from the dataset***.

***Glucose***  

Some women suffer from very severe hypoglycemia (44) and some others suffer from prediabetes (199), although the majority have a normal glycemic index (100).
It seems that in ***the graph of this category there should be a distribution skewed to the right and flattened (around 117 approximately)***.
***Low data dispersion***.
***The outliers that have been completely eliminated from the dataset***.

***Blood pressure (pressure)***  

Normal diastolic blood pressure is around 70, which indicates slight hypotension, although within the correct range.
Some women suffer from very severe hypotension and some others suffer from hypertension.
Diastolic pressure is very well distributed around the mean and median and seems to correspond to a slightly hypotensive population (72).
It seems that ***the graph for this category should have a somewhat skewed distribution to the right and pointed (around 72 approximately)***.
***Low data dispersion***.
***The outliers that remain are totally tolerable***.

***BMI***  

It seems that these women are, in general, obese (type I) and in some cases they could even suffer from morbid obesity (type III).
There seems to be a ***Gaussian distribution, slightly skewed to the right, around 32, therefore there should not be much bias***.
It seems that ***the graph for this category should be flattened (around 32 approximately)***.
***Low data dispersion***.
T***he outliers that remain are tolerable and the values ​​are reasonable***.

***Diabetes pedigree function (pedigree)***  

Most women seem to have a low background of 0.4, but there are none with no background.
It seems that ***the graph for this category should have a distribution that is slightly skewed to the right and very sharp (around 0.4 approximately)***.
***Average data spread***.
***The outliers that remain are tolerable***.

***Age***  

The women in the sample are between 20 and 80 years old, approximately.
The most repeated age is 22 years, which indicates that most women are in their fertile age.
The population is, in short, relatively young.
It seems that ***the graph for this category should have a distribution that is skewed to the right and slightly sharp (around 29 years approximately)***.
***Average data spread***.
***The outliers that remain are tolerable***, although it is the second highest in the dataset (1.17%). The age values ​​are reasonable, for example, there are no women aged 427.
