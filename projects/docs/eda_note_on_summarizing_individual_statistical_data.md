## EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)  

### **_Note on summarizing individual statistical data_**   

The method describe() of the dataframe is too short in our case. The mode, median, and so on, are missing.

To solve this problem, we define our own functions, with which we build a data frame.

The dataframe obtained should allow us to perform a perfect statistical analysis of the curve corresponding to each characteristic.
