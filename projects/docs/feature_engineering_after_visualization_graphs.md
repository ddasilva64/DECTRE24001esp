## Numerical characteristics (after visualization of the graphs)

***Pregnancies***  

* Some women in the sample have many children (12 or more), although most have few; the normal is to have only 1 child.
* ***The graph of this category has a distribution skewed to the right and flattened (around 3 approximately)***.
* ***High data dispersion***.
* ***The outliers that have been completely eliminated from the dataset***.

***Glucose***  

* Some women suffer from very severe hypoglycemia (44) and some others suffer from prediabetes (199), although the majority have a normal glycemic index (100 to 120).
* ***The graph of this category has a distribution skewed to the right and flattened (around 117 approximately)***.
* ***Low data dispersion***.
* ***The outliers that have been completely eliminated from the dataset***.

***Blood pressure (pressure)***  

* Normal diastolic blood pressure is around 70, which indicates slight hypotension, although within the correct range.
* Some women suffer from very severe hypotension and some others suffer from hypertension.
* Diastolic pressure is very well distributed around the average and the median and seems to correspond to a slightly hypotensive population (72).
* ***The graph for this category has a somewhat skewed distribution to the right and pointed (around 72 approximately)***.
* ***Low data dispersion***.
* ***The outliers that remain are totally tolerable***.

***BMI***  

* It seems that these women are, in general, obese (type I) and in some cases they could even suffer from morbid obesity (type III).
* There seems to be a Gaussian distribution, slightly skewed to the right, around 32, therefore there should not be much bias.
* ***The graph for this category is flattened (around 32 approximately)***.
* ***Low data dispersion***.
* ***The outliers that remain are totally tolerable***.

***Diabetes pedigree function (pedigree)***  

* Most women seem to have a low background of 0.4, but there is no one with no background.
* ***The graph for this category has a distribution that is slightly skewed to the right and very pointed (around 0.4 approximately)***.
* ***Medium data spread***.
* ***The outliers that remain are tolerable***.

***Age***  

* The women in the sample are between 20 and 80 years old, approximately.
* The most repeated age is 22 years, which indicates that most women are in their fertile age.
* The population is, in short, relatively young.
* ***The graph for this category has a distribution that is skewed to the right and slightly pointed (around 29 years approximately)***.
* ***Medium data spread***.
* ***The outliers that remain are tolerable***.
