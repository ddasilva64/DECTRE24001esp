## Executive Summary  

### **_Project Overview_**   

This project aims to ***develop a robust predictive Machine Learning model*** to ***detect diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics***.

Leveraging the comprehensive dataset of Pima native women from Arizona (USA), which includes features such as glucose level, BMI, age, and so on, we aim to ***create a model capable of accurately identifying individuals with diabetes***.

Given the ***importance of early detection*** and intervention in diabetes management, our main emphasis lies on ***maximizing the model's ability to correctly classify positive cases (patients with diabetes)***, making ***positive class*** a ***crucial metric***.

### ***Objectives***

1. ***Explore the dataset***: Investigate patterns, distributions, and relationships in the data.

2. ***Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA)***: Delve into bivariate relationships with the target variable.

3. ***Preprocessing steps***:
    * Eliminate irrelevant features.
    * Treat missing values.
    * Treat outliers.
    * Encode categorical variables.
    * Transform biased features to achieve normal-like distributions.

4. ***Build the model***:
    * Establish pipelines for models that require scaling.
    * Implement and adjust classification models (decision trees and random forest).
    * Emphasize the ***comprehensive identification of people with diabetes***.

5.***Evaluate and compare model performance***: Use the precision, recall, and F1-score indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of the models.

### ***Datasource description***  

We will be using the ***[<span style="font-family:Verdana; font-size:0.95em;color:red">Pima indians diabetes dataset from Kaggle</span>][r000]*** in our project.  

The dataset contains medical information from Pima native women from Arizona (USA), who participated in a diabetes study in the 1984, as we said.

We know that the data collected in the study are: Number of pregnancies, plasma glucose concentration, diastolic blood pressure, triceps skinfold thickness, serum insulin concentration, BMI (Body Mass Index), diabetes function based on family history, age, and whether they have diabetes (0=no; 1=yes).
