# Feature Engineering (individual variable conclusions)  

## Individual variable conclusions

* We have eliminated the features with an excessive % of outliers (>20%), because they cannot provide reliable information.  

* We have eliminated or reduced the % of outliers to acceptable levels, for the other features.  

* The numerical predictions coincide with the graphs obtained.  

* ***We need to obtain conclusions by crossing variables***.
